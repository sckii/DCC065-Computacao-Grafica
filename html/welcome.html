		<hr>

		<p>On this page you will find the basic projects that support the [link:https://sites.google.com/site/computacaograficaufjf/ Computer Graphics course] at [link:https://www2.ufjf.br/ufjf/ UFJF].</p>

		<p>All projects were developed in [link:https://threejs.org three.js], a cross-browser JavaScript / API library used to create and display animated 3D graphics on the web. You can access our repository [link:https://github.com/rodrigoluis/CG here].</p>

		<h2>Contents</h2>

		<p>You will find in this page projects regarding geometric models, 3D object modeling, scene and virtual camera concepts and topics about lighting and texture usage. </p>

		<p>Additionally you will find examples of more advanced techniques such as raytracing, virtual reality and augmented reality.</p>

      <p>Our course notes will be available (in portuguese) <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/computacaograficaufjf/aulas" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
